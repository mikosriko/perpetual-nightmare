# Perpetual Nightmare
A platformer game I made during first year where you control a figure across the dark world traversing through obstacles to escape your nightmare!

# Instructions
Go to [https://mikosriko.github.io/perpetual-nightmare/](https://mikosriko.github.io/perpetual-nightmare/).  

Platform your way across the map while avoiding obstacles to win! Collectibles are optional and add an additional challenge to the game.

# Controls
- **Move Left**   = A
- **Move Right**  = D
- **Jump**        = W
- **Dash**        = Shift

Have fun!
